# Elite dangerous commodities search
 app for searching stations with specific commodities


It is able to download all necessary data and make csv file of all systems with wanted commodities.
I'm currently work on algoryth which calculates distance between your system and closest system with wanted commodity.
All data after dowloading and preparing requires around 340mb.

To use it, u need some external libraries:
-tqdm
-wget
-pandas

It is project for learning purposes.
